GOMIS Quick Start & Troubleshooting

- Open PowerShell in the main project directory (where this file is located).
	- if Using VS Code click Ctrl + J to open terminal
- Run:
    pwsh ./build-all.ps1
  This will build the main app, validator, EXE, and installer in one go, from anywhere.
  See gomis-installer/build-all.log for detailed logs.

1. Build the Project (Alternative)

- Open PowerShell in the gomis-installer directory.
- Run the all-in-one build script:
    pwsh ./build-all.ps1
  This will build the main app, validator, EXE, and installer in one go.
  See build-all.log for detailed logs.

Manual Maven Build:
- If you only want to build the Java project:
    ./mvnw.cmd clean install
  Or in VS Code/IDE terminal:
    powershell | ./mvnw.cmd clean install

2. Install and Access the Database

- Run the GOMIS installer you just built (found in resources/Output or as specified in the build log).
- To access the MariaDB database after install:
    & "C:\Program Files\MariaDB 11.4\bin\mariadb.exe" -u root -p gomisdb
  Enter the password you set during installation.

3. Run the Application

- Use the installed shortcut, or run the main class directly:
    gomis\src\main\java\lyfjshs\gomis\Main.java

Troubleshooting

- Database error:
    Run the installer to create the database.
    Default DB password is: YourRootPassword123! (see gomis\src\main\java\lyfjshs\gomis\Database\DBConnection.java)
- Installer/Build errors:
    Check build-all.log for details.
    Ensure all files are present in resources/.
- Null Frame:
    Me and ChatGPT don't know how to fix it, try recompiling the project
