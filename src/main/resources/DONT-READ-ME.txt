Hey there! Just a heads up about GOMIS:

There are some visible flaws in the system, especially with input validation. 
The database setup is kinda basic too - password is just sitting there in the code.

To future programmers:
- Watch out for input validation, it's kinda weak
- Database security needs work
- UI sometimes acts up with that null frame thing
- Maybe add some proper error messages

If you're fixing this, start with the input validation stuff. 
That's probably the most important thing to fix right now.
